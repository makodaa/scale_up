Okay, I have managed to unify the navigation, and make it work with the session token thing.
However, whenever I register, there is this side effect where it is logged in (not sure if we ARE, but we are being redirected to home.)
I am pretty sure I have removed all references of this. Anyways, time to investigate tomorrow.

Also, I have to work on the search, databaseÂ (persistence), and the lesson page tomorrow. It's a long day.
